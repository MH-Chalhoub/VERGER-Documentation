# Objectifs :
This program serves to solve the difficulties encountered by the owner of the orchard at the level of memorizing all the payments, the receipts, the employees and their payments and the invoices of the market and this program is more efficient and more precise than the traditional way.

The orchard is made up of several parts the payments, the receipts, the employees and their payments and the invoices of the market and somehow they are all connected, and this program helps to know at the end of each season if the orchard is winning or losing, based on the data entered by the owner of the orchard.

This program helps to plan for the future, based on data collected in the previous years which helps to predict the production of the next seasons. And know the causes of shortening if there is.

Ex: knowing which products to pay the most and when the demand for these products increases in order to organize the process of harvesting these products in a way that allows you to profit as much as possible.
